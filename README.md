# Quantum Circuit Simulator

### Description
This project is a basic **Quantum Circuit Simulator** built in C++ with an **Embedded Control System Interface**. It simulates quantum circuits using qubits and quantum gates like Hadamard and Pauli-X, and provides a simple interface for controlling the quantum operations.

### Features
- **Qubit Representation**: Each qubit is represented using a complex vector.
- **Quantum Gates**: Includes gates like Hadamard (H), Pauli-X (X), and others.
- **Measurement**: Collapses the qubit's state based on probability amplitudes.
- **Control Interface**: Simulated interface for communicating with embedded systems (to be extended).
